Intro words:
Initially, I have picked Lin-SW algorithm for imlementation, but got stuck with understanding how the merge of buckets of summary elements works. Since GK-01 algorithm was needed for correct work of Lin-SW, I have accmplished its implementation and present it there. ;(

### GK-01 algorithm
The basic idea is that when N increases, the set of -approximate answers for querying Ï†-quantile expands as well, so correctness can be retained even if removing some elements. <br>
The implementation of the algorithm you can find in my repository using this [link](https://github.com/LeoSvalov/stds-assignment1).
